The Australian Government supports cyber security tools, like encryption,
that create a safe online environment for Australians. Encryption ensures
that everyday digital transactions, like online banking or shopping, can
occur securely. The Government has no interest in undermining these
critical technologies.

Unfortunately, the same technologies are being employed by terrorists,
paedophiles, drug smugglers and human traffickers to conceal illicit
activities and facilitate crime. Criminals are increasingly sophisticated
users of the internet and rapid technological change has caused valuable
sources of evidence and intelligence to diminish, for example:

   - over 95 per cent of the Australian Security Intelligence
   Organisation=E2=80=99s (ASIO) most dangerous counter-terrorism targets u=
se
   encrypted communications
   - encryption impacts intelligence coverage in nine out of ASIO=E2=80=99s=
 10
   priority cases
   - it is estimated that by 2020 all electronic communications of
   investigative value will be encrypted.

The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and
Access) Act 2018 (the Assistance and Access Act) equips agencies with the
tools they need to effectively operate in the digital era and keep the
Australian community safe. The Assistance and Access Act introduced some
key reforms to help our agencies access the evidence and intelligence they
need by:

   - enhancing industry cooperation with law enforcement and security
   agencies
   - improving agency computer access powers.

Importantly, nothing in this legislation can require industry to break
encryption. Instead, the measures enhance the existing ability of
Australian agencies to undertake targeted, proportionate and independently
oversighted surveillance activities.

The operation of the Assistance and Access Act is subject to ongoing review
by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and by
the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.

   This PDF contains a flowchart that sets out the different options for
   and stages of the industry assistance process under the Assistance and
   Access Act. The flowchart gives a high-level summary of: the key
   considerations that agencies and Ministers must take into account in
   requesting or requiring industry assistance; the requirements for agenci=
es
   to notify providers of their obligations and rights of complaint to
   oversight bodies; and that oversight bodies must be notified of requests=
 or
   notices being issued.

Enhanced industry cooperation

The modern Australian communications industry is open, data-based and
involves a wide-range of onshore and offshore providers. The Assistance and
Access Act allows law enforcement and security agencies to seek assistance
from the full scope of companies that supply communications services and
devices in Australia.

The Assistance and Access Act does not place any standing obligations on
companies. Robust consultation measures will ensure that both Australian
and multi-national companies can have a say in potential requirements. The
Government will not require companies to do the impossible. By default,
industry is compensated for all reasonable costs of complying with a
request from Government.
Safeguards

Engagement between Government and industry is bounded by critical
safeguards. All requirements must be reasonable, proportionate, practical
and technically feasible. Government cannot:

   - build or implement so-called =E2=80=98backdoors=E2=80=99 or do anythin=
g that would
   make the communications of innocent persons less secure
   - build a decryption, interception or data retention capability
   - access communications without an existing warrant or authorisation
   - compel an employee to undertake activities without the knowledge of
   their employer

Division 7 of Part 15 of the *Telecommunications Act 1997* gives the force
of law to some of these core limitations.

The regime also contains robust oversight mechanisms, including:

   - extensive independent scrutiny by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the
   Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and a clear complaints
   mechanism to these bodies
   - public transparency reporting by companies who have received a notice
   to assist
   - independent review of new capabilities by a technical expert and
   retired judge
   - judicial review of any requirements on industry
   - annual reports, tabled in Parliament, on the use of powers

These safeguards ensure that industry assistance is collaborative,
constructive and does not jeopardise cyber security.

in the legislation, see:

Modern warrants for the digital age

The new, independently-approved, collection powers will improve the ability
of agencies to operate around encryption without undermining it. The
purpose of these warrants is to ensure agencies can lawfully access
intelligible communications content.

The Assistance and Access Act strengthens the ability for law enforcement
and security agencies, under warrant, to collect evidence from electronic
devices. An independent authority approves the use of these powers and
agency activities are subject to oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman or
the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security.
